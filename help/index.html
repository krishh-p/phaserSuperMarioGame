          <p style="text-align: left;">
            • Jump on top of the <strong>green tubes</strong> to pass them. You may need to jump from tube to tube to pass! <br>• <strong>Bricks</strong> act as solid players and do not break. This allows players to move arround them and use them as platforms<br>• Treat the <strong>stairs</strong> the same way you would treat a brick; it's a solid object that the player can maneuver around<br>• <strong>Mystery blocks</strong> are solid blocks that do not break just like the bricks, except they produce a coin when the player's head it hit against the bottom of the block

          <h2>Ladders</h2>
          <p>
            To go up a ladder, make sure your player is overlapping with the ladder and you're holding the UP key at the same time. This will bring you up the ladder. These are added so you can go back in the map, you don't get stuck (have an escape), and to reach higher platforms in the map.
